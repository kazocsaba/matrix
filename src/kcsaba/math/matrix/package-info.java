/**
 * This package provides interfaces for matrices and vectors, as well as a factory
 * class for creating instances. Strong typing is enforced on the instances, meaning that
 * if a Matrix instance has a single column, that it will in fact be a Vector instance, and
 * if it also has 3 (or 4) rows, it will implement Vector3 (or Vector4).
